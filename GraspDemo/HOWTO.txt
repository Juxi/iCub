compile it first.
For running GraspDemo the following other modules need to be running:

 - MoBeE (with a loaded object)
 - LEOGrasper (with the same part loaded as using in the demo)

bonus but not required: icVision to update the object location


./GraspDemo --robot icub  --part right_arm --object cup1


then in the rpc port you can send the following:
star	: start the grasping 
stop	: stop the grasping
quit	: close it
